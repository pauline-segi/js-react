// this is a comment
// you can use command forward slash to comment out

// myScript.js

let greeting = "Saluations, friends!"; // <- initial declaration

greeting = "Hey handsome, coding all by yourself?"; // <- reassignment

// the main two variables we use in react are:
// let is a declaration that can change -- var and let are the same, but var is the outdated version, so always use let instead
// const is a constant that can't change

// Best practice is to use const by default, and only use let when you need tochange the value of a variable.

// JS uses camelCase:
// camelCase
// snake_case
// kebab-case
// PascalCase

// JS eg. for camelCase
// const myUserData = []

// semi colons don't matter so much as they used to, but they are used anyways -- they can be used or not, but it is best practice to ALWAYS use them 


// with numbers, we have two options:
// floats are decimals
// integers are whole numbers
